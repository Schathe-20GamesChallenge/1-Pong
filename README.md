# 🏓 Pong - 20 Games Challenge #1

This is the first game in the [20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/challenge/#1): **Pong**, a classic arcade game and a perfect starting point for learning game development with **SFML**. This project helped me revisit and reinforce key concepts in C++ game development.

## 📅 Progress

🔄 **In Progress** — The core gameplay is functional, and stretch goals are being refined.

---

## 🎯 Game Objectives

- ✅ Create an arena with two walls and a center divider  
- ✅ Add two paddles controlled by players  
- ✅ Implement a ball that bounces off walls and paddles  
- ✅ Detect when the ball leaves the playfield and assign points  
- ✅ Display the score for both players  

---

## 🌱 Stretch Goals Achieved

- 🤖 Basic AI to play against the computer  
- 🧭 Start menu with reset option  (maybe)
- 🔊 Sound effects for collisions and scoring  (really not sure)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Tool        | Purpose                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| **C++**     | Main programming language        |
| **SFML**    | Graphics, sound, and input       |
| **CMake**   | Project configuration            |
| **Ninja**   | Build system backend             |
| **VSCode**  | Development environment          |

SFML is automatically downloaded via CMake using `FetchContent`, so no manual installation is required.

## 🎮 Controls

*TODO: update*
- **Player 1**: `W` (up), `S` (down)  
- **Player 2**: `Arrow Up`, `Arrow Down`  
- **Menu**: `R` to restart, `Esc` to quit

## 📸 Preview

*TODO: (Add one or two screenshots of the game in action here)*

## 📚 What I Learned

While I was already familiar with some of the concepts, this project gave me the opportunity to revisit and solidify:

- Creating and managing SFML windows  
- Handling keyboard input with SFML  
- Structuring a C++ project with CMake  
- Basic collision detection and game logic  
- Implementing a simple AI opponent
